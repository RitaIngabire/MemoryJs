To get started with the Memory Game, 
it's important to know what you're working with. 
Here are some very first steps you could take,
some of which you may have done already but I'm
n0t sure where you're at.

Read the project description and rubric so 
you know what criteria your project will need to meet.

Download the starter code to your computer and 
open it in your code editor.

Run the starter code by opening up index.html in Chrome.

Inspect elements on the page with dev tools and see what 
you can find out. Look at what classes the cards that are flipped 
over & showing an icon have applied to them vs the cards that aren't 
flipped over.

Look at the source code for index.html in your code editor - there 
are some elements hard coded there including cards.

Look at the source code for app.css in your code editor to see what 
styles are being applied. Do you have an idea of how you might flip 
a card over yet?

Look at the source code for app.js in your code editor and see 
if the comments at the bottom give you an idea. Also there's a 
shuffle function and a comment above it about displaying cards on 
the page. However, when you looked at index.html there were cards 
hard coded there. Does it make sense to leave those cards hard coded 
in index.html if they are to be shuffled?

If you think about the project all at once, it can seem overwhelming,
 but the key is to break it down into very small steps. Think about 
 what's the first small step you can takeâ€¦.you won't be implementing 
 all the functionality at once, just get one little thing working. If 
 you make a mistake or need to change it when continuing, that's ok. 
 After you get one thing working, move on to the next small step you 
 can take.
